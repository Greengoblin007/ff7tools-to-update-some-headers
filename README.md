# ff7tools-to-update-some-headers

As you may or may not know, Cebix forgot to include some useful tools in his package (https://github.com/cebix/ff7tools). To be more specific, he allows to decompress the files OPENING.BIN (SQUARESOFT logo at the beggining) and STAFF2.BIN (ending credits), but he did not offer a tool to automatically update the headers once you recompress the files. I programmed some tools in Python 3 to get the job done. Regards!
